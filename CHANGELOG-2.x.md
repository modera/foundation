| Old                                                                                                              | New alternative                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Semantic config modera_backend_security's keys - "mail_service" and "mail_sender"                                | See modera_security/password_strength/mail                                                                                         |
|                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                    |

that a user is currently authenticated (using default Symfony security component), then we will try to

a new file to the repository, you can use "context" argument of \Modera\FileRepositoryBundle\Repository\FileRepository::put
method to specify "author" and "owner" properties which, if provided, will be set to the corresponding properties on
a created StoredFile.

## 2.54.0 (30.01.2017)

* bugfix [MPFE-974] TranslationsController from BackendTranslationsTooBundle could not properly render exception
 in listWithFiltersAction() method. This bug was caused by removal of "modera_server_crud.persistence.default_handler"
 in 2.53.0 (which is restored back in this release, see below MPFE-954).

    | Old name                        | New name             | Type       |
    |---------------------------------|----------------------|------------|
    | Site                            | General              | Category   |
    | User management                 | Administration       | Category   |
    | Access administration interface | Access Backend       | Permission |
    | Access Tools section            | Access Tools Section | Permission |
    | Access users and groups manager | Access Users Manager | Permission |
    | Manage user profiles            | Manage User Profiles | Permission |
    | Manage permissions              | Manage Permissions   | Permission |
    
 If the labels turn out to be viable then later in scope of MPFE-963 their ID will also be renamed to match labels,
 for now old IDs can be used to contribute new permission to categories.
    
* bugfix [CLS-534][MPFE-941] some backend classes' translation tokens now are formatted properly, they were preventing UI
from being rendered.
* [MPFE-954] "modera_server_crud.persistence.default_handler" service reverted and can be used now.  
* feature [MPFE-951] ModeraMjrIntegrationBundle now provides new extension-point "modera_mjr_integration.help_menu_items",
which adds support for contributing implementations of `\Modera\MjrIntegrationBundle\Help\HelpMenuItemInterface` to a newly
added "Help" menu (which is rendered if there's at least one HelpMenuItem available, the Help icon is rendered where
username and exit buttons are in the Backend's header). To see more information regarding how you a contribution
to this extension points could look like run 
`app/console sli:expander:explore-extension-point modera_mjr_integration.help_menu_items`, if you want to generate an 
empty contribution for then you can use `app/console sli:expander:list-extension-points` command. **This feature requires
MJR version to be at least 0.3.0.**

## 2.53.0 (08.12.2016)

* feature [MPFE-852] ModeraServerCrudBundle now is able to deal with optionally custom EntityManager, to achieve
 this a new implementation of PersistenceHandlerInterface has been added - DoctrineRegistryPersistenceHandler, which
 uses an implementation of RegistryInterface to resolve entity manager which should be used for an entity. See
 UPGRADE-2.x.md for more details.
* feature [MPFE-949] now all CSS script URLs in /backend section will contain timestamp of their last modification
* feature [MPFE-950] a composer.json has been regenerated with help of modera/composer-monorepo-plugin, now it
 contains all dependencies of nested bundles and therefore can be easily installed as a standalone package
* feature [MPFE-946] Added ability to run scripts from nested JSON (usually are composer.json) files. By specifying
 this kind of "extra" in your root composer.json:
 
         "extra": {
            "modera-module": {
                "include": [
                    "src/Modera/*/composer.json"
                ]
            }
         }
         
 All composer.json files which match "include" GLOB expression would have their "scripts" tags executed as if they were
 declared in root composer.json. Here's a sample part of nested composer.json:
   
        // included
        "extra": {
           "modera-module": {
               "scripts": {
                   "post-package-install": [
                       "Modera\\ModuleBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::doctrineSchemaUpdate"
                   ],
                   "post-package-update": [
                       "Modera\\ModuleBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::doctrineSchemaUpdate"
                   ]
               }
           }
        }
