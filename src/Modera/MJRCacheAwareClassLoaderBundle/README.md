# ModeraMJRCacheAwareClassLoaderBundle

This bundles enables browser caching mechanism for MJR application, so once page is loaded then all scripts will be
permanently cached in client's browser and further page loads will not require any pre-cached scripts to be loaded
again. Shortly speaking, this is how this bundle works - it adjusts Ext.Loader class that is used to dynamically load your
scripts so it would append so called `version` number and when bundle is configured it will be suffixing all loaded
script files with that version and in conjunction with properly configured web-server ( apache/nginx instructions
provided ) next time page is loaded pre-cached scripts will be used.

## Installation

### Step 1: Download the Bundle

``` bash
composer require modera/mjr-cache-aware-class-loader:6.x-dev
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) of the Composer documentation.

### Step 2: Enable the Bundle

This bundle should be automatically enabled by [Flex](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/flex.html).
In case you don't use Flex, you'll need to manually enable the bundle by
adding the following line in the `config/bundles.php` file of your project:

``` php
<?php
// config/bundles.php

return [
    // ...
    Modera\MJRCacheAwareClassLoaderBundle\ModeraMJRCacheAwareClassLoaderBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```

Optionally you may specify a version number using bundle's semantic config, to do this you need to add this to your 
config file:

``` yaml
// config/packages/modera.yaml

modera_mjr_cache_aware_class_loader:
    version: '1.5.0'
```

### Apache2

To instruct client's browser that it should use cache we will need to have `mod_expires` apache module installed. On Debian
like system this can be done by issuing these commands:

``` bash
sudo a2enmod expires
sudo service apache2 restart
```

Once the module is enabled you can take `Resources/server/.htaccess` file shipped with this bundle and put it to
your web directory. Feel free to tweak provided .htaccess, since the only real thing that you need from it is
`<IfModule mod_expires.c>` section. If caching still doesn't work make sure that support for .htaccess files is enabled
(check your virtual hosts definition in `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/` directory or if you don't use virtual hosts
 then take a look at `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`, please make sure that configuration property `AllowOverride` is set
 to `All` in `<Directory>` configuration section).

### Nginx

Update your virtual host ( default location on Debian-like system is `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` ) and to your `server`
configuration section add this:

``` nginx
location ~*\.js\?v=$ {
    expires 1y;
}
```

And then restart nginx:

``` bash
sudo service restart nginx
```
